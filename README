There are several reasons for the importance of life on Mars. For Example:-
1) The population of the Earth is increasing rapidly.
2) Shortage of land on the Earth after some decades.(As many island will submurge in water)
3) It is the most habitable planet or you can say "Gunpowder is set up on he ground, just we need spark" because:-
Cyanobacteria are bacteria that are responsible for life and the atmosphere and on Earth they are present. 
We will carry some and put them in water on Mars.

After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system due to several reasons:
1)Its soil contains water to extract.
2)It isn't too cold or too hot.
3)There is enough sunlight to use solar panels.
4)Gravity on Mars is 38% that of our Earth's, which is believed by many to be sufficient for the human body to adapt to.
So this idea came to my mind and with my resarch, it is absolutely possible to live on Mars without spacesuit.
